# Package Analysis Summary - Quick Reference

## 📊 Analysis Results

### ✅ IMPLEMENT: django-guardian
**Recommendation:** HIGHLY RECOMMENDED  
**Timeline:** Sprints 1-4 (incremental rollout)  
**Effort:** 20-30 hours (medium complexity)  

**Why:**
- Critical for CASA compliance (pilot certifications, aircraft access control)
- Perfect fit for aviation business requirements
- Low integration risk - extends existing permissions
- Essential for client data segregation

**Use Cases:**
- Pilots access only their authorized flights
- Maintenance staff restricted to qualified aircraft
- Client project data segregation
- Operations manual access by certification level

---

### ❌ REJECT: django-allauth
**Recommendation:** NOT RECOMMENDED  
**Reason:** Conflicts with existing system  

**Why NOT:**
- Duplicates existing CustomUser email authentication
- Requires complete UI redesign (breaks DarkLight Meta branding)
- Complicates CASA compliance (ARN/TFN validation issues)
- Social login not in current requirements
- High effort (40-60 hours) for minimal benefit

**Better Alternative:**
- Enhance existing email verification system
- Add OAuth providers only when required (later)

---

### ⏸️ DEFER: django-unfold
**Recommendation:** CONDITIONAL (Stage 2)  
**Timeline:** 3-6 months post-MVP  
**Effort:** 15-25 hours (low-medium complexity)  

**Why Defer:**
- Nice to have, not essential for MVP
- Default admin is functional for current needs
- Better to focus on core RPAS features first
- Two Tailwind stacks adds maintenance overhead

**Reconsider If:**
- Staff spend >4 hours/day in admin
- Custom dashboards become critical
- Core RPAS features complete

## 🎯 Recommended Action Plan

### Immediate (Next Sprint):
1. ✅ Review full analysis: `PACKAGE_ANALYSIS.md`

### Sprint Breakdown:
- **Sprint 1:** Foundation setup, authentication backend
- **Sprint 2:** Flight operations permissions
- **Sprint 3:** Aircraft and client project permissions
- **Sprint 4:** Safety management system permissions

### Stage 2 (Post-MVP):
- ⏸️ Evaluate django-unfold based on admin usage metrics
- ⏸️ Build custom dashboards if needed
